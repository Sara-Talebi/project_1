The **main.py** file contains main function to define all variables and constants and calling functions. To observe any changes for ODE and integration just change parameters in this function.

The **ode_method.py** contains implementation of Euler's method and Runge-Kutta 4th order method on the Hill differential equation and plotting them. also, plotting the RK4 result versus scipy provided RK45.

In the **integ_method.py**, integration methods of the following are codded:
    * Riemann sum left
    * Riemann sum right
    * Composite_simpson in two different versions (I prefer version 2 :D)
    * Simpson rule 1/3 
    * Trapizoidal rule version 1 and 2 (I like version 1)
    * Scipy functions
